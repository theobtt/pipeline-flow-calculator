# Pipeline Flow Calculator

A simple Python tool to calculate Reynolds number, Darcy friction factor, and pressure drop for pipe flow systems. 
Ideal for chemical/process engineers and anyone needing quick fluid dynamics estimates via CLI or a web interface.

## Features

- Compute **Reynolds number** (Re = rho.u.D / mu)  
- Estimate **Darcy friction factor** using the laminar flow formula 
- Calculate **pressure drop** via the Darcyâ€“Weisbach equation  
- Optional **Streamlit** GUI for interactive input 
- Automated **pytest** suite to validate core calculations
